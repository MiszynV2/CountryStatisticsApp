#CountryStatisticsApp
I created this project to develop my javascript/html/css skills.
It is an application that allows you to search country statistics.
I get the data from `https://restcountries.com/ and https://api.worldbank.org/
This project is created in React with heart.

To run application:
- Node version - v16.20.1
- npm install
- npm run
