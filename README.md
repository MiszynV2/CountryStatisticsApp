#CountryStatisticsApp (before CovidRaportApp)
I created this project to develop my javascript/html/css skills.
It is an application that allows you to search country statistics.
I get the data from `https://restcountries.com/ and https://api.worldbank.org/
This project is created in React with heart.

To run application:
- website: https://countrystatistics-wm.vercel.app
- Node version - v 16.20.0
- npm install
- npm run
